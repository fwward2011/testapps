	<h3 style="font-weight:700;">Cash Rewards Terms and Conditions</h3>
	<p>The Sam’s Club Cash Rewards program is a membership benefit <em><strong>exclusively for U.S. Sam’s Club Plus Members</strong></em>. The program allows Plus Members to accrue Cash Rewards on qualifying purchases at Sam’s Club. Earned Cash Rewards are loaded on to the membership account at the end of each membership year (12-month period) and are then available for redemption as cash or credit.</p>

	<h3 style="font-weight:700;">How to Earn and Use Cash Rewards</h3>
	<em><strong>Sam’s Plus Members</strong></em> earn $10 in Cash Rewards for every $500 in qualifying pre-tax purchases during a membership year with a maximum reward of $500 per 12-month period. Cash Rewards are loaded onto the Sam’s Plus Member account about two months before the end of the membership year (award date) and may be redeemed on purchases in clubs, on SamsClub.com, or for conversion to cash in the club. Returns for refund of qualified purchases are deducted from calculation. If a member earns $2,000 in Cash Rewards (Maximum Balance) and that amount remains on the membership account, Cash Rewards will stop accruing. A member must lower the amount below the Maximum Balance to accrue Cash Rewards again. Only qualifying purchases made by the primary, complimentary or company cardholder in a Sam’s Club facility located in the United States (excluding Puerto Rico) or on SamsClub.com or SamsClub.com-hosted websites qualify for Cash Rewards. Business Membership Add-On cardholders do not qualify to earn Cash Rewards for themselves or their primary cardholder. Returns of qualifying purchases are deducted from accrual of Cash Rewards.<p>

	<h3 style="font-weight:700;">Maximum Balance of Cash Rewards</h3>
	<p>At any time a total of earned Cash Rewards reaches its Maximum Balance of $2,000, Cash Rewards will no longer accrue. A member must reduce the Maximum Balance of Cash Rewards (use for purchase or convert to cash) in order for Cash Reward accrual to begin again. There is no retroactive credit of Cash Rewards earned for purchases made during the time of Maximum Balance.<p>

	<p>Only the primary or complimentary cardholders on a membership account may access and redeem the Cash Rewards loaded on the membership account. Purchases made from a Business Member’s ‘Company Card’ Membership card count towards the Member Company’s annual Cash Reward, but a Company cardholder will not have access to view or redeem Cash Rewards.<p>

If a revoked membership has earned Cash Rewards from a previous membership year, that amount shall be mailed to the most recent membership address on file. The revoked member shall not be able to collect Cash Rewards in a Sam’s Club.</p>
